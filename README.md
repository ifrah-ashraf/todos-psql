# Todo Application

This project implements a Todo application with two interconnected tables: `todos` and `todos_user`. 

## Overview

- **Tables**:
  - `todos`: This table stores the individual todo items.
  - `todos_user`: This table manages the relationship between users and their todos, connected through foreign keys.

## API Design

I have designed and implemented APIs for both the `todos` and `todos_user` tables, allowing for comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Testing

All API functionalities were tested using Postman to ensure proper operation and data management.
